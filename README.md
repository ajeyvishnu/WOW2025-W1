# Workout Wednesday 2025 | Week 1 | Replicating Quick Table Calcs in Tableau  

## Introduction  
This repository contains my solution for the Workout Wednesday 2025 Week 1 Challenge. The goal was to create two area charts without using Quick Table Calculations or the `RUNNING_SUM()` function, using Tableau and the Sample Superstore dataset (2024 version).  

The challenge involves:  
1. A Running Total of Sales by Month  
2. A 3-Month Moving Average of Sales by Month (including the 2 previous months + the current month)  

## Challenge Details  
- **Dashboard Size**: 1000 x 700  
- **Dataset**: Sample Superstore (2024 version)  
- **Restrictions**:  
  - No Quick Table Calcs  
  - No `RUNNING_SUM()` function  
- **Requirements**:  
  - Two area charts with colors `#a16eaf` (Running Total) & `#67c79c` (Moving Average)  
  - Matching tooltips and formatting  
  - Single worksheet solution  

## Solution Overview  
This solution utilizes custom calculated fields to replicate Quick Table Calculations:  
1. **Running Total**:  
   A calculated field was created to compute the cumulative sum of sales by month.  
2. **3-Month Moving Average**:  
   A calculated field was created to compute the average of sales over the current and prior two months.  

The solution is designed in Tableau, meeting all requirements of the challenge.
